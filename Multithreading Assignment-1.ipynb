For example, If thread T1 acquired resource R1 and it also needs resource R2 for it to accomplish its task.

    "A simple example of a race condition is a light switch. In some homes, there are multiple light switches connected to a common ceiling light. When these types of circuits are used, the switch position becomes irrelevant. If the light is on, moving either switch from its current position turns the light off. Similarly, if the light is off, then moving either switch from its current position turns the light on.\n",
